# remote
#### here's what i have learned about seeing my remote :
* when we run the git remote command we can view the short names like “origin,” of
 all specified remote handles.

* By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.

**I tried it and it worked fine with me**
