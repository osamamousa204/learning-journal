# remote
Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes,
Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. 
#### So what is git ??
Briefly Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time I save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it
   
 
#### here's what i have learned about seeing my remote :

* when we run the git remote command we can view the short names like “origin,” of
 all specified remote handles.

* By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.

**I tried it and it worked fine with me**
