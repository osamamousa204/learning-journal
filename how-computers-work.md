# How do compuyers work??

### Well to answer this question we need to know :
what makes a computer a computer? 
A computer is a programmable machine. The two principal characteristics of a computer are: It 
responds to a specific set of instructions in
a well-defined manner and it can execute a
prerecorded list of instructions (a program).

## how information is represented using electricity??

The only electric storage in a computer is dynamic RAM. This memory uses electric charge 
in a tiny capacitor to remember if the bit is 1. The elements with no charge are 0.

Flash storage uses a related scheme, charge stored in a thin film oxide, so that the last value written 
is preserved when the power is removed.

Other kinds of memory use other technology. Hard disks use magnetized particles on a spinning platter.

## how computers use circuits??
Computer circuitry, Complete path or combination of interconnected paths for
electron flow in a computer. Computer circuits are binary in concept, having 
only two possible states. They use on-off switches (transistors) that are 
electrically opened and closed in nanoseconds and picoseconds (billionths and
trillionths of a second). A computerâ€™s speed of operation depends on the design 
of its circuitry. Faster rates are achieved by
shortening the time it takes to open and close the switches and by developing
circuit paths that can handle the increased speeds.
