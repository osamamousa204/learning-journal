# Intro to JS 
### first thing you need to know that js allows you to make your web page more interactive .

#### Also js allows you to :

1. Access content :
  that means you can select any element you want from html wether it's an element,attribute or a text by :
    * Select the text inside all of the <hl>
      elements on a page
    * Select any elements that have a
      c1ass attribute with a value of note
    * Find out what was entered into a
      text input whose id attribute has a
      value of emai1
      
2. You can use JavaScript to add
    elements, attributes, and text to the
    page, or remove them. For example:
      * Add a paragraph of text after the
        first <hl> element
      * Change the value of c 1 ass
        attributes to trigger new CSS rules
        for those elements
      * Change the size or position of an
        <img> element.
  ## The ABS of programming
      ### A :
              What is a script and how do I create one?
                *A script is a series of instructions that a
                 computer can follow to achieve a goal.
                *To write a script, you need to first
                  state your goal and then list the
                  tasks that need to be completed in
                  order to achieve it by :
                    1.  DEFINE THE GOAL
                    2.  DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
                    3. CODE EACH STEP
  
      ### B :
              How do computers fit in with the world around them?
              
      ### C :
              How do I write a script for a web page? 
              
  ### The summry
   * A script is a series of instructions that the computer
     can follow in order to achieve a goal.
      Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
    all the instructions.
   * Computers approach tasks in a different way than
      humans, so your instructions must let the computer
      solve the task prggrammatically.
   * To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
      a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
      to complete that task (a flowchart can help)
