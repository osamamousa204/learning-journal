# Intro to JS 
### first thing you need to know that js allows you to make your web page more interactive .

#### Also js allows you to :

1. Access content :
  that means you can select any element you want from html wether it's an element,attribute or a text by :
    * Select the text inside all of the <hl>
      elements on a page
    * Select any elements that have a
      c1ass attribute with a value of note
    * Find out what was entered into a
      text input whose id attribute has a
      value of emai1
      
2. You can use JavaScript to add
    elements, attributes, and text to the
    page, or remove them. For example:
      * Add a paragraph of text after the
        first <hl> element
      * Change the value of c 1 ass
        attributes to trigger new CSS rules
        for those elements
      * Change the size or position of an
        <img> element
